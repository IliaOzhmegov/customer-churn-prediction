Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges any business can possibly be faced with. Losing customers means losing revenue and sales income. This is why it is very important for business to be able to predict which clients might be at risk of leaving the company. 
According to Forbes, there are at least three main fiscal reasons why businesses would like to retain their customers:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Even a 5% reduction in churn rate can increase profits anywhere from 25% to 95%.
  \item It costs five to seven times more to acquire new customers.
  \item The probability of selling new products or services to existing customers is 60% to 70%, versus the 5% to 20% chance of selling to a new customer.
\end{itemize}


In our research we try to tackle this paramount business problem by trying to predict customer churn. We do so by applying and comparing two Machine Learning Methods: Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
